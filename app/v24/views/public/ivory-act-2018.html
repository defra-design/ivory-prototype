        <p class="govuk-body">The UK government has banned the sale of most items containing ivory, to help <a href="#" class="govuk-link">stop elephant poaching</a>.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">However, as long as you buy a permit before each sale, you can still trade in the following items:

          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>Items with less than 10% ivory made before 1947</li>
            <li>Musical instruments with less than 20% ivory and made before 1975</li>
            <li>Portrait miniatures made before 1918</li>
            <li>Items to be acquired by an accredited museum</li>
            <li>Items of outstandingly high artistic, cultural or historical value made before 1918</li>
          </ul>

        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Not sure whether your item can be sold? <a href="guidance" class="govuk-link">Read the guidance</a></p>
